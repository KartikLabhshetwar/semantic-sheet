"What is our achievement rate by month?"

-- Revenue Analysis
"Which months had highest revenue?"
"Find revenue growth patterns" 
"Show target vs actual comparisons"

"Which person performed poorly in sales?"
"Show sales team performance rankings"
"Find underperforming team members"
```

##  Configuration & Deployment

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key | Required | For response generation only |
| `CHROMA_PERSIST_DIRECTORY` | Vector DB storage path | `./chroma_db` | Persistent embeddings |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Sentence transformer model | `all-mpnet-base-v2` | Upgraded for better accuracy |
| `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE` | Maximum text chunk size | `1000` | Optimized for business data |
| `CHUNK_OVERLAP` | Overlap between chunks | `200` | Ensures context continuity |
| `TOP_K_RESULTS` | Base retrieval count | `20` | Adaptive: 12-25 based on query |

### Performance Tuning

**Embedding Model Selection**:
- `all-mpnet-base-v2`: **Current** - 768D, high accuracy, moderate speed

**Retrieval Strategy**:
- **Comprehensive Queries**: 15-25 chunks for business analysis
- **Specific Queries**: 12-20 chunks for targeted information
- **Confidence Threshold**: 60-95% typical range for business data

**Memory Optimization**:
- ChromaDB handles vector storage efficiently
- Batch processing for large datasets (32 chunks/batch)
- Automatic collection management and cleanup

### Advanced Configuration

For custom embedding models or different vector databases, modify the respective modules in `src/embedding/` and `src/vector_store/`.

## Development & Testing

### Architecture Decisions

**Multi-Strategy Retrieval Pattern**:
```python
# Implemented adaptive retrieval strategy
def _comprehensive_retrieval(self, query: str, query_embedding: List[float], top_k: int):
    # Strategy 1: Semantic similarity
    # Strategy 2: Comprehensive business data
    # Strategy 3: Temporal coverage
    # Deduplication and relevance ranking
```

**Confidence Scoring Algorithm**:
```python
# Multi-factor confidence calculation
confidence = (
    avg_relevance * 0.4 +           # 40% similarity scores
    completeness_score * 0.3 +      # 30% data completeness  
    type_diversity_score * 0.2 +    # 20% chunk diversity
    query_match_bonus               # 10-15% query type bonus
)
```

**Business Context Understanding**:
- Enhanced prompt engineering for financial terminology
- Variance analysis pattern recognition
- Target vs. actual relationship mapping
- Time-series data continuity validation

**Test Categories**:
- Unit tests for each RAG component
- Integration tests for end-to-end query processing  
- Business logic validation for financial calculations
- Performance benchmarks for large dataset processing

### Code Quality Standards

- **Type Hints**: Full typing support with mypy validation
- **Logging**: Structured logging with configurable levels
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and inline comments
- **Performance**: Optimized embedding batch processing and caching

### Adding Custom Chunk Types

To add new semantic chunk types:

1. Modify `src/ingestion/spreadsheet_reader.py`
2. Add new chunk creation methods
3. Update the embedding pipeline in `src/embedding/embeddings.py`

### Custom Embedding Models

To use a different embedding model:

1. Update `EMBEDDING_MODEL` in `.env`
2. Ensure the model is compatible with Sentence Transformers
3. Popular alternatives:
   - `all-mpnet-base-v2` (higher quality, slower)
   - `all-distilroberta-v1` (balanced)

##  Performance Tips

1. **Large Files**: For very large spreadsheets, consider:
   - Increasing `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`
   - Using a more powerful embedding model
   - Processing in batches

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Use specific questions for better results
   - Adjust `TOP_K_RESULTS` based on your needs
   - Clear old data before processing new files

3. **Memory Management**:
   - ChromaDB automatically manages memory
   - Clear collection when switching datasets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**:
   ```
   ValueError: GOOGLE_API_KEY is required
   ```
   Solution: Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in your `.env` file

2. **Import Error**:
   ```
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src...'
   ```
   Solution: Run from project root directory

3. **Excel File Error**:
   ```
   ValueError: Failed to load workbook
   ```
   Solution: Ensure file is a valid Excel format and not corrupted

4. **Memory Issues**:
   Solution: Reduce `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE` or use a smaller embedding model

5. **Rate Limit Error (429)**:
   ```
   429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
## Advanced Troubleshooting

### System Performance Issues

**Low Confidence Scores (<50%)**:
```bash
# Check embedding model loading
INFO:embedding.sentence_transformers_embeddings:Loaded embedding model: all-mpnet-base-v2
```
- Ensure `all-mpnet-base-v2` model is loaded (not the old `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- Restart application if model hasn't upgraded
- Check if query matches comprehensive keywords for expanded retrieval

**Insufficient Context (8 chunks instead of 16+)**:
```bash 
# Should see this for business queries:
INFO:query.rag_processor:Query requires comprehensive data - expanding retrieval
INFO:query.rag_processor:Retrieved 16 chunks using comprehensive strategy
```
- Business queries like "sales performance", "variance analysis" should trigger comprehensive retrieval
- Minimum 12 chunks guaranteed for all queries as of latest update
- Check logs for keyword matching patterns

**Memory/Performance Optimization**:
```bash
# Monitor batch processing:
INFO:embedding.sentence_transformers_embeddings:Processing batch 17/17 (31 chunks)
INFO:embedding.sentence_transformers_embeddings:✅ Successfully generated embeddings for 543 chunks
```

### Business Query Troubleshooting

**Query Classification Issues**:
- **Comprehensive Queries**: variance, profitability, exceeded, targets, sales, performance
- **Temporal Queries**: months, quarters, trends, time-series data  
- **Specific Queries**: exact values, formulas, individual cells

**Multi-File Context Contamination**:
- Current system treats all uploaded data as unified knowledge base
- For multiple Excel files with overlapping terminology, results may cross-contaminate
- Recommendation: Process similar business contexts together, separate unrelated data

### Debug Configuration

```python
# Enable comprehensive logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

# Monitor retrieval strategy
logger = logging.getLogger("query.rag_processor")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Production Deployment Considerations

**Embedding Model Compatibility**:
- Ensure consistent model versions across environments
- `all-mpnet-base-v2` requires ~500MB download on first run
- Consider model caching strategies for containerized deployments

**Vector Database Scaling**:
- ChromaDB persistence directory should be mounted for container deployments
- Regular cleanup of old collections recommended for long-running instances
- Monitor disk usage as embedding storage grows with data volume
